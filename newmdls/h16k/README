h16k_ver100.mdl uses the "Black Boxing" trick to improve the development efficiency. The technique is described in the Casper Memo No.28(http://casper.berkeley.edu/wiki/images/a/a4/Black_box_memo.pdf).

Since some of the steps (Extract entity, place pcores in the design, etc) have been done already, so to compile h16k_ver100.mdl, there's no need to run through every steps described in the memo.
To compile h16k_ver100.mdl:
0) Enter the directory vegas_devel/newmdls/h16k
1) Open fftwbr_core.mdl
2) Double click on the System Generator block, click the "Generate" button. Wait for the generation to complete.
3) Open pfbfirr_core.mdl
4) Double click on the System Generator block, click the "Generate" button. Wait for the generation to complete.
