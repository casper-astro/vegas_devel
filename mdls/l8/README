### COMPILING ###

l8_verXXX.mdl uses the "Black Boxing" trick to improve the development efficiency. The technique is described in the Casper Memo No.28(http://casper.berkeley.edu/wiki/images/a/a4/Black_box_memo.pdf).

Since some of the steps (Extract entity, place pcores in the design, etc) have been done already, so to compile l8_ver100.mdl, there's no need to run through every steps described in the memo.

To compile l8_verXXX.mdl:
0) Enter the directory vegas_devel/newmdls/l8
1) Open cichbcic_core.mdl
2) Double click on the System Generator block, click the "Generate" button. Wait for the generation to complete.
5) Open l8_ver100.mdl
6) Compile it as with other regular mdl files.
