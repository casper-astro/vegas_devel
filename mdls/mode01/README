Model file naming convention:
the first block is the mode (e.g. v01 is vegas mode 1);
the second block is the adc being used (aa is asiaa adc, na is the national adc);
the third block is the fpga board used (ri is roach 1, rii is roach 2);
the fourth block is the demux of the adc, the number of taps in the pfb, and the 
number of pts in the fft (e.g. 8r4t11f is demux by 8, 4 taps, and 2^11 pt fft)

v01_aa_ri_8r4t11f_ver101.mdl -- this is simply a copy of v01_na_ri_8r4t11f_ver102.mdl with 
				the national adc switched out for the asiaa adc

v01_na_ri_8r4t11f_ver101.mdl -- functional mode 1 design mostly functional at low clock 
				rates.  Some optimizations for speed have not been made

v01_na_ri_8r4t11f_ver102.mdl -- functional mode 1 design, optimized for speeds up to 360MHz

v01_na_ri_8r4t11f_ver103.mdl -- (TESTING) functional mode 1 containing snap blocks for adc 
				and packet headers.  Low clock speeds.. probably no longer 
				useful

v01_na_ri_8r4t11f_ver104.mdl -- (TESTING) functional mode 1 containing snaps for adc and a 
				mux of the input to the pfb.  This was added to test the 
				sync pulse

v01_na_ri_8r4t11f_ver105.mdl -- (TESTING) functional mode 1 copy of ver4 with register to
				test SSG
