The model files for l8_lbw1 and l8_lbw8 should be the same.
The conf scripts are the same except for the line 
   >>> fpga.write_int('mode_sel', 0)  # mode l8_lbw8
   OR
   >>> fpga.write_int('mode_sel', 1)  # mode l8_lbw1


----------------------
Model files:
  ver121:    @1.5GHz, 8 subbands, but the goto tags going into the reshaper are all from subband1 in fact. That needs to be fixed.
  ver121_01: @1.5GHz, 1 subband only
  See the notes in the ../../mdls/l8 folder for more info.

Notes:
  (1) Histogram? 
	>>> hist(getadc0(), 60) # very nice
	>>> hist(get_mixer_ri(1, 're'), 60) # spacings???
	>>> hist(get_dr16(1).real, 60) # not as nice but overall okay
	>>> hist(get_halfband(1).real, 60) # still not bad
	>>> hist(get_chc(1).real, 60) # OUCH
