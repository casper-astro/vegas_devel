Notes:
  (1) Parameter combinations working for BWRC settings (clean single spike):
	boffile = ver100 or ver104 (others haven't been testd but will probably work as well) 
	Input signal ampl: -15 dBm
	acc_len = 96
	fftshift = 0b101110111111111 # 9 consective 1s in the end
	And latter two parameters are consistant with github commit as of Apr 10, 2013


Problem:
  (1) The channel shape function doesn't quite work for this mode - because in the model file, the snap block for reshaper ('rshpout') only packs 1024 values. But a full spectrum in this mode has 16k channels. So we can't get a complete spectrum in the rshpout snap blocks.
